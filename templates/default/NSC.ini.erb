; RemoteConfiguration IS AN EXTREM EARLY IDEA SO DONT USE FOR PRODUCTION ENVIROMNEMTS!
;RemoteConfiguration.dll
; NSCA Agent is a new beta module use with care!
;NSCAAgent.dll
; LUA script module used to write your own "check deamon" (sort of) early beta.
;LUAScript.dll
; Script to check external scripts and/or internal aliases, early beta.
; Check other hosts through NRPE extreme beta and probably a bit dangerous! :)
;NRPEClient.dll
; Extreamly early beta of a task-schedule checker
;CheckTaskSched.dll


[Settings]
;# OBFUSCATED PASSWORD
;  This is the same as the password option but here you can store the password in an obfuscated manner.
;  *NOTICE* obfuscation is *NOT* the same as encryption, someone with access to this file can still figure out the
;  password. Its just a bit harder to do it at first glance.
;obfuscated_password=Jw0KAUUdXlAAUwASDAAB
;
;# PASSWORD
;  This is the password (-s) that is required to access NSClient remotely. If you leave this blank everyone will be able to access the daemon remotly.
;password=secret-password
;
;# ALLOWED HOST ADDRESSES
;  This is a comma-delimited list of IP address of hosts that are allowed to talk to the all daemons.
;  If leave this blank anyone can access the deamon remotly (NSClient still requires a valid password).
;  The syntax is host or ip/mask so 192.168.0.0/24 will allow anyone on that subnet access
;allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1/32

;# USE THIS FILE
;  Use the INI file as opposed to the registry if this is 0 and the use_reg in the registry is set to 1
;  the registry will be used instead.

;
; # USE SHARED MEMORY CHANNELS
Module0Load;  This is the "new" way for using the system tray based on an IPC framework on top shared memmory channels and events.
;  It is brand new and (probably has bugs) so dont enable this unless for testing!
;  If set to 1 shared channels will be created and system tray icons created and such and such...

[NSCA Agent]
;# CHECK INTERVALL (in seconds)
;   How often we should run the checks and submit the results.
;interval=5
;
;# ENCRYPTION METHOD
;   This option determines the method by which the send_nsca client will encrypt the packets it sends
;   to the nsca daemon. The encryption method you choose will be a balance between security and
;   performance, as strong encryption methods consume more processor resources.
;   You should evaluate your security needs when choosing an encryption method.
;
; Note: The encryption method you specify here must match the decryption method the nsca daemon uses
;       (as specified in the nsca.cfg file)!!
; Values:
;	0 = None	(Do NOT use this option)
;	1 = Simple XOR  (No security, just obfuscation, but very fast)
;   2 = DES
;   3 = 3DES (Triple DES)
